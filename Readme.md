# Smart Notifications readme



Orchard CMS module that adds the ability to have closable, fading or persistent notifications. The standard Notifier service is used so all existing notifications can be changed from site settings.

If you want to add closable, fading or persistent notifications from code explicitly just use the extension methods on `INotifier` added by the module.

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/smart-notifications](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/smart-notifications) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Smart-Notifications](https://github.com/Lombiq/Smart-Notifications) (Git repository)
