# Smart Notifications



Orchard CMS module that adds the ability to have closable (can be closed with an X in the corner like windows), fading (fades out in a few seconds) or persistent notifications (will be shown until the user closes them). The standard Notifier service is used so all existing notifications can be changed from site settings (and thus you can e.g. make all appearing notifications closable).

If you want to add closable, fading or persistent notifications from code explicitly just use the extension methods on `INotifier` added by the module.
